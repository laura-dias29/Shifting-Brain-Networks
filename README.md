# Shifting-Brain-Networks

This repository contains the scripts used in the analysis of the paper: 'Shifting Brain Networks: Functional MRI connectivity differences between resting-state and a multi-element passive viewing task'
The goal of this study was to test a passive viewing task created in the context of the BRAVE study, with the purpose of enhancing the shift between brain networks, when compare dto a resting state approach. We hypothesise that, by viewing a complex task formed by blocks of stimuli with the purpose of evoking specific networks, the correlation between the time series of regions belongig from distinct networks is stringer than the correlation of the same regions, but in a resting state acquisiston.
